My solutions for some challenges on codingame.com
- The first challenge: Implement the closestToZero function to return the temperature closer to zero which belongs to the list ts.
If ts is empty, return 0 (zero).
If two numbers are as close to zero, consider the positive number as the closest to zero (eg. if ts contains -5 and 5, return 5).

- The last challenge: You work for a shop that wishes to give a discount of discount% to the most expensive item purchased by a given customer during the sales period. Only one product can benefit from the discount. 
You are tasked by the shop owner to implement the function calculate_total_price(prices, discount) which takes the list of prices of the products purchased by a customer and the percentage discount as parameters and returns the total purchase price as an integer (rounded down if the total is a float number).
