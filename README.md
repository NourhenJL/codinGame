My solutions for some challenges on codingame.com
- The first challenge is to implement the closestToZero function to return the temperature closer to zero which belongs to the list ts.
If ts is empty, return 0 (zero).
If two numbers are as close to zero, consider the positive number as the closest to zero (eg. if ts contains -5 and 5, return 5).
